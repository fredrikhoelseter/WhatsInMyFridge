# Design guidelines for Group 6 (mobile applications)
### Application:
What's in my fridge application

### Theme:
The main purpose of this project is to create an organized and easy to use application for everyone to use. Therefore, the design should be simple and straightforward. Visually the application should look bright and clean (no clutter and crammed in information or images etc.).

### Color scheme:
The main coloration of the application will be green with white accents. Colorized indicators during actions like swipe to delete(red) and add product (light blue).

### Hierarchy and layout:
When successfully logged in to the application, your page will display as the main page. In this section your different fridges/freezers or cabinets should be displayed. From there you should be able to view the contents of the different storage units by tapping the individual tabs. When viewing the content, how to add, delete and edit products should be obvious.

### Images and icons:
Icons for the specified category (meat, fish, beverage etc.), sign in/register indicators (e-mail, phone nr, google etc), icons for types of storage units (fridge, freezers, cabinets etc).  
reduced usage of images, images could be implemented for recipes.

### Typography:
Font: Open Sans (widely used font in both mobile applications and web development)  
Thin and fairly large font (black and white, depending on contrasting colors)

### Borders / Shadows:
Borders should be rounded according to sketches and initial thoughts (especially for buttons and displayed storage units). Shadows to make buttons/sections stand out from a white background.
